* Change 'event_checks' to 'input_checks'

Version 2
=========
* Logical event processing with mini language
  * Example:
      on_topic( 'foo/bar/baz',
          timer( 0.1, output(3, msg()) ),
          timer( 0.1, output(3, ! msg()) ),
      )
    Which says: on getting foo, set the output to the message value for 0.1 
    seconds, and then set it to boolean not of the message value for 0.1 
    seconds, then return it to its original state.
